# Front-End Developer Test

## Introduction

Welcome to the Nouveau Lashes Technical Test!

We hope that you find this exercise fun. There are no trick questions; we want to see your well thought-out and well structured code.

## The Brief
The aim of this exercise is to create a well structured html web page.

Please find an image called webPage.png and mobileWebPage.png, this is the web page we would like you create (mobileWebPage.png is how the page should look on mobile devices).
 
If you require any placeholder image please use https://placeholder.com/ or icons from http://fontawesome.io/

You should use best practices where appropriate. Principles we value include: responsive, performance, accessibility and usability.

Feel free to use any frameworks you feel would fit this project.

Please be mindful of all the different browser types.
